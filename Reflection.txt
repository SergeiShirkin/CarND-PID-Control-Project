Reflection for CarND PID Controller Project

I decided to tune Kp, Ki, and Kd parameters manually
and after some efforts set them like this:
Kp = 0.3
Ki = 0.0004
Kd = 4.0.

Ki parameter is the smallest one because it is multiplied by the sum
of all cte. Sometimes the cte can quickly increase, so it is 
not safe to make Ki large as the sreer_value can be overcorrected.

Also I changed the throttle parameter from initial valuee of 0.3 to 0.15
so the car started to move stablier (without oscillations).
